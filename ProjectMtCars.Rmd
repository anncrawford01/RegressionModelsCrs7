## Executive Summary
Apply regression models and exploratory data analyses on mtcars to answer the following:
1. Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG?
2. Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions


From the help
A data frame with 32 observations on 11 variables.

[, 1]	 mpg	 Miles/(US) gallon
[, 2]	 cyl	 Number of cylinders
[, 3]	 disp	 Displacement (cu.in.)
[, 4]	 hp	 Gross horsepower
[, 5]	 drat	 Rear axle ratio
[, 6]	 wt	 Weight (1000 lbs)
[, 7]	 qsec	 1/4 mile time
[, 8]	 vs	 V/S
[, 9]	 am	 Transmission (0 = automatic, 1 = manual)
[,10]	 gear	 Number of forward gears
[,11]	 carb	 Number of carburetors

```{r cars}
summary(mtcars)

str(mtcars)
```
```{r mpg}
### Step 1 examine the data.
y <- mtcars$mpg
x <- mtcars$am
# check for nas 
sapply(mtcars,function(x) sum(is.na(x)))
sapply(mtcars, function(x) length(unique(x)))

library(dplyr)
mtcars <- mutate(mtcars, trans = ifelse(am == 0, "automatic","manual"))


```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:



```{r plottransMPG, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
g = ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = as.factor(trans), y = mpg))
g = g + ylab(" Miles/(US) gallon")
g = g + xlab("Transmission")
g + geom_boxplot()
g
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
