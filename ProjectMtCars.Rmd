## Executive Summary
Using mtcars data set of 32 observations and 11 variable. Apply regression models and exploratory data analyses to answer the following:
1. Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG?
2. Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions

From the help
A data frame with 32 observations on 11 variables.

[, 1]	 mpg	 Miles/(US) gallon
[, 2]	 cyl	 Number of cylinders
[, 3]	 disp	 Displacement (cu.in.)
[, 4]	 hp	 Gross horsepower
[, 5]	 drat	 Rear axle ratio
[, 6]	 wt	 Weight (1000 lbs)
[, 7]	 qsec	 1/4 mile time
[, 8]	 vs	 V/S
[, 9]	 am	 Transmission (0 = automatic, 1 = manual)
[,10]	 gear	 Number of forward gears
[,11]	 carb	 Number of carburetors

```{r cars}
summary(mtcars)

str(mtcars)
```
```{r mpg}
y <- mtcars$mpg
x <- mtcars$am

fit1 <- lm(mpg ~ . , data = mtcars)
summary(fit1)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
